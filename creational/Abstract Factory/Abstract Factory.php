/**
 * DESING PATTERN -  Factory
 * 
 * The purpose of any factory class, is to create and return instances of other classes, 
 * just like a real world factory creates products.There are two types of factory design patterns
 *   One is called the factory method and 
 *   The other is called an abstract factory. 
 *   There is another not official pattern called simple factory.
 * 
 * Abstract classes can not be instantiated
 *
 * It can be inherited and overwrite methods.
 * 
 * All messengers (Sms, Email) should extend this abstract Message class.

/**
 * The is the factory which creates message objects.
 * 
 * Simple Factory:
 *  The factory class must have a static method, this is called a factory method.
 *  The factory method must return a class instance.
 *  Only one object should be created and returned at a time.
 * 
 * Simple factories, which are sometimes called static factories, are the simplest form of a factory. 
 * Although itâ€™s not an official design pattern, it does have itâ€™s uses especially in small to mid sized applications.
 * Simple factories are classes which can return a single class (these are called product classes) instance,
 * the class to initialise could be hard coded (if the factory only returns objects of one particular product) 
 * or determined at runtime (if there are multiple classes which could be initialised), this is commonly done 
 * with a switch statement.
